<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Improve your file type checker’s pattern match logic by rewriting the pattern search algorithm. Use some of the advanced algorithms you have learned so far like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. Check your program’s search performance with some huge file. Compare your improved search engine with a naive implementation. If you’re a Linux user, you can use <code class="java">"time"</code> for measuring execution time, (see <code class="java">man time</code> for details). Otherwise, you can use <code class="java">nanoTime()</code> from the <code class="java">java.lang.System</code> class. Check the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime()" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Your program should accept another argument, that represents an algorithm, a naive implementation that you've implemented in the previous step marked as <code class="java">--naive</code> and KMP algorithm marked as <code class="java">--KMP</code>. Other arguments (file name, pattern and file type) should be parsed after this one.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<p>First, we've checked the naive implementation, and it took roughly 5 seconds. Then KMP showed 5 times better performance. You should expect similar behavior from your program.</p>
